Quick Start Guide:

# use command line to make an app from the setup.py file:
$pip install py2app
$pip install py2exe
$python setup_v0.02.py py2app -A
$python setup_v0.02.py py2exe -A
# (you must be in the setup.py's directory)

--> download this GitHub repository and un-zip it;
--> than build the app using the command line as described above.
--> paths to data files (icon and .gif) are relative and should not give any errors
--> setup_v0.02.py greps DanielsTestApp_v0.01.py and additional parameters for build
--> setup_v0.02.py should also allow for cross-plattform use (windows uses py2exe instead of py2app)
